# Week 2 Homework

The goal of this homework is to familiarize ourselves with the Bootstrap front-end framework.

## An experiment

We're going to try something new this week; as homework, you are going to watch a video and work along with it. Then, during class, we'll try to have more hands-on labs.

**The hope is that you'll be able to follow along with the material better if you can pause and rewind at your own pace, and in class we'll have more time for labs and conversation.**

I look forward to your feedback!

## Introduction

There are several parts to this homework.

First, we'll learn how to improve the landing page that we made in class by using the Bootstrap framework to achieve pixel-perfect positioning.

Next, we'll learn how to make our pages look prettier by using built-in Bootstrap classes for common web elements like buttons.

Next, we'll apply what we learned to the roster we started building in class.

Next, you will familiarize yourself with the Bootstrap documentation by creating a cheatsheet for yourself. **This part is not graded; it's just for your own benefit, so feel free to do it at your leisure.** You don't have to submit it by next week.

The instructions (and solutions) for this portion can be found in the [Week 2 Homework Instructions video](http://boothappdev-s15.github.io/videos/week_2_hw_instructions.html).

## Mockups

Now, for the main objective: use what you have learned so far about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to start creating screens for one of your app ideas.

In the folder `4_mockups`, I have included a few mockup templates for you which are already all set up with the Bootstrap assets. You can ignore all the stuff in the `<head>` of the document and just start adding your own stuff to the `<body>`.

Choose one or two or three important screens from your app ideas and see how far you can get creating them. You could do a landing page, or a homepage, or a sign up page, or whatever.

Sketch it out on paper, and then try to translate your sketch into code. **Usually I start by identifying the rows and columns in my sketch**, and I add a skeleton of `<div class="row">` and `<div class="col-md-X">` to the document. Then I go and plug in content into each cell.

There's a neat tool called [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io/) that I find very helpful for creating my Bootstrap grids. [I recorded a brief video demonstrating it.](http://boothappdev-s15.github.io/videos/shoelace.html).

Refer heavily to the Official Bootstrap Documentation and the Cheatsheet we just made in Part 3. Copy over components that you think will be useful in your idea.

This portion is not graded, but take a real stab at it; the more you force yourself to think through it now, the easier things will be later.

A tip: try to populate your mockups with realistic dummy data. I find that realistic data makes it much easier to reason about the design, as opposed to [lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) filler text.

## Good luck! 

Remember, think up lots of questions to ask on First Draft or in class! That's the whole point.
